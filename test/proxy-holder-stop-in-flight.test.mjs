// standby to keep a real port alive, and a test wants its ephemeral port
// released. Nothing else ends one, so this file has to.
//
// Selected by the standby's OWN declaration of its parent, never by name or age:
// a relay whose ppid no longer matches CACHE_FIX_STANDBY_PARENT has been
// orphaned, and matching that parent against the holders THIS FILE spawned is
// what keeps the sweep off production and off other sessions. The PORT is matched
// too, and the relay's own command must be one of ours (OURS): a pid this file
// once spawned can be a live holder's by now, and its standby names it as parent
// just as ours did.
