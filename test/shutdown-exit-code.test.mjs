  // `Connection: close` rides a request. A client that goes QUIET at the drain

  // that socket or it stays pinned to a departing proxy.
  //
  // ba2375b assumed node did that for us. It does from 19 on; 18.20.8 does NOT
  // — measured directly, a bare http server's idle keep-alive never closes on
  // 18 where 20.20.2 and 24.11.1 close it in 1-2 ms. Worse on the same major:
  // that socket also keeps close() unresolved (see forcedCloseLine's note), so
  // the handover spends its ENTIRE budget, which 6d6f01d just raised to 30
  // minutes. A quiet client on Node 18 was pinned for all of it.
  //
  // So this asserts OUR contract, not node's: a draining proxy leaves no idle
  // keep-alive open, on every major engines admits. The busy half is already
  // covered above ("tells a keep-alive client to close once it is draining"),
