// next one.
//
// The holder's guarantee is that the ADDRESS ALWAYS HAS AN OWNER — a session
// bakes HTTPS_PROXY at exec, so one refusal strands it for good. It does not
// promise that a caching proxy is behind that address every instant, and three
// of the four buckets below are states where it is not and nothing is lost:
//
//   served     200. a proxy answered.
//   carrying   503 {"carrying":"gap-relay"}. THE HOLDER'S OWN MECHANISM. It
//              re-opens the gap on the child-death path and closes it as the
//              successor spawns, and through that window it carries real
//              traffic and 503s /health ONLY — a 200 there would announce a
//              proxy that does not exist. Measured with the window forced to
//              400ms: 19 of 20 probes, body {"carrying":"gap-relay"}. On a fast
//              box the window is ~0 and it never appears, which is why this
//              cost CI 31137828018 (node 18) and would not reproduce locally in

//   refused    NOBODY OWNS THE PORT. the one thing that strands a session.

// Its own file: every case here drives a REAL launcher holding a REAL port, so

// runs each test file in its own process, which keeps that blast radius here.
// Concurrent, but BOUNDED BY CORES: each case boots a real proxy under its own
// 10s startup budget, and unbounded concurrency blew that budget on the CI
// runner — measured, "Proxy failed to start within 10s" on every node, while a
// 48-core box passed every time. Serial, the file pays the sum of the waits; at
// half the cores it pays close to the longest one without starving any boot.
//
// availableParallelism(), NOT cpus().length — the first version of this bound
// counted the MACHINE, which is not the same as the cores this process may use.
// Measured under `taskset -c 6,7`, this very expression: with cpus().length it
// computes 24, with availableParallelism() it computes 2. A bound of 24 does not
// bound this file — it has fewer children than that — so every case ran at once
// on two cores, and ALONE there the file failed 3 of 6 runs with no
// --test-concurrency in play. proxy-wrapper.test.mjs has 39 direct cases, where
// 24 is not merely ineffective but a real 24-way. Being bounded by the wrong
// number looks exactly like being unbounded. An affinity mask is what
// `docker --cpuset-cpus` sets too; taskset is how it was measured here.
//
// SCOPE, because the fix next door is the loud one and this should not borrow
// its credit: the red Node 20 leg was the `--test-concurrency=8` pin in
// package.json, alone. That rests on a GitHub-hosted VM carrying no affinity
// mask, so both calls agree there and this bound was already doing its job —
// which is NOT measured either, and is flagged rather than dropped because the
// whole SCOPE claim hangs off it.
//
// HOW MANY CORES that runner has is deliberately NOT claimed here. Two attempts
// to pin it down failed honestly: "2 vCPU" was asserted from habit and never
// measured, and a later attempt to derive it from a green run's TAP timings
// (sum of durations 83.7 s against a 58 s step) collapsed once the 39.8 s of
// nested subtests counted twice inside their parents was removed — 43.9 s of
// work in 58 s, which is what SEQUENTIAL looks like. The argument does not need
// the number: a constant of 8 cannot be right on a machine nobody measured.
//
// Nor does this cover a cgroup CPU QUOTA (`docker --cpus=2`), which is a
// different mechanism from a cpuset: measured by symbol presence in the shipped
// binaries, `uv__get_cgroupv2_constrained_cpu` is absent from Node 18.20.8
// (uv 1.44.2) and 20.20.2 (uv 1.46.0) and present in 24.11.1 (uv 1.51.0). So on
// 18 and 20 availableParallelism() is no better than cpus() under a quota, and
// on 24 it is — 22 was not checked. The mask is the case fixed here.
//
// THE COST, since nothing else in this diff records it: dropping the pin takes
// the suite from 85 s to ~265 s over two pinned cores, about 3x. That is the
// price of the only configuration measured green, and the post-fix CI step has
// not been timed.
//
// VERSION FLOOR, which `engines` does not state: availableParallelism() landed
// in Node 18.14, and a named import of it from node:os is a module-load
// SyntaxError below that — this file and proxy-wrapper.test.mjs would die
// before a single case ran. `engines` says >=18 and is deliberately NOT raised:
// no shipped code uses this (it appears nowhere in bin/ or proxy/), and `files`
// excludes test/, so raising it would constrain consumers for a dev-only need.
// CI's `18` resolves to the latest 18.x. Recorded, not guarded.
//
// THE FLOOR IS 1. `Math.max(2, ...)` used to defeat the halving on exactly the
// machines it exists for — floor(2/2) is 1, so a two-core runner computed 2 and
// booted two real proxies at once. Identical on any box with 4+ cores, which is
// why it survived every local run. Arithmetic, not a CI fix: it was proposed as
// one and suite-collection.test.mjs records that hypothesis REJECTED.
