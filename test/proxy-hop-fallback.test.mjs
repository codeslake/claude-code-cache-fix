// A hop that is OFF must be routed around, not answered with 502.
//
// A session bakes HTTPS_PROXY at exec and never re-reads it, so it cannot fail
// over itself: when the hop it names goes away, that session is stranded for
// its whole life. The proxy is the one process in the chain that can re-decide,
// because config.httpsProxy is read per request.
//
// Measured on lmd42 before this: with the upstream hop refused, every request
// came back 502 and a live session saw the chain as dead.
