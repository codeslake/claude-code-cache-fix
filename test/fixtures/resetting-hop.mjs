// A forward (CONNECT) proxy that reproduces a hop dropping a live connection
// instead of answering it -- the shape a hop dropping the leg below it showed
// on 2026-09-06 (accept, CONNECT, then RST, no retry, no response). See CCF's
// proxy/upstream.mjs forwardRequest(), which this fixture's own tests exercise
// via resetFirstConnect / stallFirstConnect.
//
// Every CONNECT is relayed byte-for-byte to `forward` once accepted. With
// resetFirstConnect, the FIRST CONNECT REQUEST this process reads (a
// connection that actually sent "CONNECT ...", not merely one that connected)
// is destroyed right after being read, before any reply; every CONNECT after
// that is served normally. With stallFirstConnect, that same first CONNECT
// request is read and then never answered at all (the hop accepted it and
// went silent — measured 2026-09-07 05:45-05:48Z, 20s of nothing then a 0.6s
// answer); every CONNECT after that is served normally. Counting only a
// connection that sent request bytes -- not merely one CCF accepted -- matters
// because CCF's own hopAlive() probes a hop with a bytes-0 connect-and-close
// before every request; that probe must never consume the injection meant for
// the real CONNECT that follows it.
//
// Exports only, no top-level side effects (test/proc-helpers.mjs,
// test/child-deadline.mjs: same convention). Standalone, e.g. (run from the
// repo root):
//   node -e 'import("./test/fixtures/resetting-hop.mjs").then(m => m.startResettingHop({forward:"127.0.0.1:9000",resetFirstConnect:true}).listen(9100,"127.0.0.1",()=>console.log("up")))'
// `stallFirstConnect: true` instead of `resetFirstConnect`, for the silent-CONNECT mode.
