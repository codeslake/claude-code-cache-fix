// THE SUITE MUST ASK THE MACHINE HOW BIG IT IS, AND ASK CORRECTLY.

// This suite spawns real launchers, holders, relays and stand-in proxies, and

// dies` allows 2 refusals in 40 across one forced kill, which is a statement
// about how fast the holder re-acquires. Oversubscribe the runner and those
// windows widen until the bounds fail, somewhere different on each run. That is
// why the failure looked like a flake: the bound is real, the load was not.
//
// TWO knobs were wrong. They are NOT the same defect and only one of them was
// red on CI — keeping that straight matters, because the fix for the loud one
// is a flag deleted from package.json and nothing else.
//
//   THE RED ONE. package.json pinned `--test-concurrency=8` — 8 test files in
//   flight no matter what the runner is. Measured on Node v20.20.2 over two
//   pinned cores, full suite, ON THE TREE AS IT STOOD (so the inner bound below
//   was also wrong, at 24): with the pin `# fail 5` in 85 s, without it
//   `# fail 0` in ~265 s, and green on every run since across Node 18, 20 and
//   24 (1890/1890/1896 passing, no `not ok`).
//
//   That pairing is what this commit removes, and it is NOT a claim that the pin
//   alone reddens a suite whose inner bound is right: re-adding only the pin to
//   the FIXED tree ran green 5 times in a row on a peer's box (91-93 s). On the
//   real runner it was red, on that box it was not, and a stochastic failure
//   needs a rate rather than a count. Treat the 5 as "the state being removed",
//   not as the pin's yield. CI's
//   Node 20 leg was red on `refuses nothing when the proxy under it dies` while
//   18 and 22 were green — same file, a different case each run. How many cores
//   that runner has is not asserted anywhere here, on purpose; see the SCOPE
//   note in proxy-held-port.test.mjs for the two attempts to pin it down that
//   did not survive checking.
//
//   THE QUIET ONE, and it was NOT what made CI red. Two files sized their inner
//   concurrency from `os.cpus().length`, which counts the machine and ignores
//   this process's CPU affinity. Nothing suggests a GitHub-hosted VM carries an
//   affinity mask (not measured — same caveat as the core count), so both calls
//   agree there and that bound was already doing its job; under a mask they
//   diverge hard and it stops bounding anything. Fixed because it is
//   wrong wherever the process is pinned, not because it was red. The
//   measurements, and what this does NOT fix, are in proxy-held-port.test.mjs
//   beside the bound itself — not repeated here.
//
// node:test already derives its file concurrency the right way, and the formula
// is exactly `availableParallelism() - 1` — measured with six files that each
// sleep 1200 ms, counting how many start together: 1 at two visible cores, 2 at
// three, 3 at four, 4 at five. Under the pin, four such files start within
// 23 ms of each other on two cores; by default they span 3786 ms end to end.
// A constant cannot know the runner.
// A PID FOUND BY PORT IS NOT A PID WE OWN.
//
// Four files here ask `lsof` who is LISTENING on a port and then signal the
// answer — SIGHUP in six places, SIGKILL in one. The port came from a freePort()
// that binds 0, reads the number and CLOSES, so it is unowned from that instant
// and the OS hands it out again: measured, two processes each taking 3000
// ephemeral ports collided on 855 of ~2400 distinct ones. node:test runs FILES
// concurrently in their own processes and several of them listen IN-PROCESS, so
// the answer can be another runner's own pid — measured, `lsof -t` returned it
// and the kill line landed, `victim exited code=null signal=SIGHUP`. The victim
// dies with `signal: 'SIGHUP'`, `error: 'test failed'` and no case failing
// inside it, which is CI run 32087202771 (proxy-forward-attach-fallback, node
// 18) to the letter.
//
// The predicate existed at three of the seven call sites, with its own measured
// comment, and the four in-test cleanups never got it. So this pins it at the
// SOURCE instead: inside each listeners(), where no later call site can forget
// it. Pinned as an exact expression for the same reason the parallelism bound
// below is — a MENTION test passes on a comment, and a per-file variant is how
// four copies drift apart.
//
// PATH SEGMENT, NOT SUBSTRING, and that difference is a real defect this caught:
// the version at those three sites was
// /claude-via-proxy|gap-relay|server\.mjs|scratch-launcher-|scratch-fake-server-/
// and `gap-relay` matches test/gap-relay-chain.test.mjs — a file in this very
// directory that listens in-process at four sites. Ours all run a script under
// bin/ or proxy/; every test file runs one under test/, and the node binary is
// not a .mjs. Validated against 10 real command lines: 10/10 for the anchored
// form, and the substring form wrong on 1 of the same 10.
// A SUCCESSOR THAT CANNOT SPEAK IS A SUCCESSOR NOBODY CAN DEBUG.
//
// When the holder dies, the proxy spawns a replacement holder DETACHED and then
// exits. That spawn used `stdio: "ignore"`, which is /dev/null on all three fds
// — so the new holder, every proxy it supervises, and every successor of a later
// handover (those inherit) are silent forever. The line immediately after the
// spawn writes "[cache-fix] holder died; started a new one" to the DYING
// process's stderr, which is exactly the wrong way round: the departing one
// reports, the arriving one cannot.
//
// MEASURED, and it is why this is a guard and not a preference: on both Macs the
// live 9901 launcher and proxy have fd1 AND fd2 on /dev/null, so the forced-close
// drain line this PR added has been written into the void there since it landed.
// On <linux-host> the same fds are /tmp/cc-restore-9901.log and the numbers are readable.
// Same code, same fleet — the difference is only which spawn started the lineage.
//
// fd2 ONLY. stdin stays closed and stdout stays discarded: the holder's stdout
// carries the child's "proxy listening" chatter, which the launcher already
// parses over a pipe, and inheriting it would duplicate that into whatever the
// operator was looking at. Errors are the half that has to survive.
//
// INHERITING A BROKEN PIPE IS SAFE HERE. proxy/server.mjs already swallows EPIPE
