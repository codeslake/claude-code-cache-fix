// A LOST LOG READER MUST NOT WEDGE THE PROXY.
//
// Measured outage 2026-08-13 on a live 9901: a leftover `... | tee file` wrapper
// was killed, which removed the ONLY READER of the pipe the proxy holds as
// stdout/stderr. The next stderr write raised EPIPE, and because that arrives as
// an asynchronous 'error' event on the stream — not a synchronous throw — it
// became an uncaughtException. The self-heal handler then formatted err.stack
// and wrote it to the SAME broken stderr, which raised EPIPE again. `sample`
// caught the loop verbatim:
//
//   TriggerUncaughtException -> MessageHandler::ReportMessage
//     -> ErrorStackGetter -> GetFormattedStack -> FormatStackTrace
//       -> node::PrepareStackTraceCallback -> v8::Function::Call -> ...
//
// 100% CPU for 22 minutes of CPU time, 18 connections accepted and none
// answered, while /health still returned 200. The mechanism that exists to keep
// the proxy up is what took it down.
//
// The existing say() helper does not cover this: try/catch around .write()
// catches a synchronous throw, and an EPIPE on a pipe is not one.
