  // checked both ways — with the guard the port stays gone, without it a
  // replacement holder appears.

  // to its child, and the child's self-heal used to notice its holder was gone
  // and put a replacement there — correct for a holder that DIED, wrong for one
  // that was asked to release. Measured on the work Mac before this was fixed:

// A LATE EVENT FROM A RETIRED GAP MUST NOT RETIRE THE LIVE ONE.
//
// openGap() refuses to open a second gap while `this._gap` is set, so that field
// is the only thing between one acceptor on the descriptor and two. Its 'exit'
// and 'error' handlers used to null it unconditionally — but each fires for the
// gap it was attached to, and openGap runs again on every proxy restart, so a
// late event from the PREVIOUS gap cleared a LIVE successor and the next open
// stacked a second relay on the same socket. Two acceptors on one descriptor is
// the shape this file's siblings measured at 60 of 125 requests reset.
//
// DRIVEN DIRECTLY, not observed in a running holder, and that is not a shortcut.
// Measured: a real gap is unobservable by design — start() calls closeGap()
// immediately before spawning the child, because two handles may BIND one port
// but only one may LISTEN (holder.mjs:1124). Sampling `ps` at 10 ms intervals
// through boot and through a child death found a gap exactly zero times, while
// suppressing that one closeGap() made it appear at once. A property with no
// observable window has to be asked of the object that owns it.
// THE HOLDER IS THE ONLY THING THAT KNOWS A REDEPLOY FROM A STOP, and it says
// so with the signal it sends its child. `forward()` deliberately rewrites every
// stop to SIGHUP, so if the handover also used SIGHUP the proxy would see one
// word for two opposite events and have to guess the drain budget: 5s where the
// supervisor waits serially (measured, 120s against a 90s TimeoutStopSec took
// restart downtime 5.0s -> 53.9s) against half an hour where a successor is
// already serving. Source-level because the two call sites are what must differ,
// and a live handover cannot observe which signal was used.
// THE PRODUCTION STOP, WITH SOMETHING IN FLIGHT. Every other holder case here
// signals with nothing owed, so `close()` resolves at once and the case passes
// under ANY budget — a ceiling is never reached and a stall test is never asked.
// That is the gap: the one path an operator actually takes (`systemctl stop`,
// Ctrl-C, a plain kill) has never been measured with a reply in the middle of
// being delivered.
//
// WHAT IT USED TO MEASURE IS NO LONGER MEASURABLE HERE, and the replacement is
// not a weakening. The old form timed how long run-service and the proxy stayed
// ON THE PORT after a stop and required it to be the 5s ceiling rather than the
// drain budget. That clock has collapsed: the holder now settles on the proxy's
// RELEASE announcement instead of on its exit, so the port is free in under a
// second — before the first `lsof` even returns. The while loop never ran, and
// `chunks` was then sampled at the same instant as `before`, so the case died on
// its own premise (2 -> 2) while the reply it was worried about was in fact
// still streaming. Measured directly: 2 -> 158 chunks over the ten seconds after
// the stop, holder gone inside 623 ms, and the only listener left was the
// standby relay, which a stop keeps on purpose.
//
// So this pins the two halves that ARE observable, and together they are
// STRONGER than the old assertion. "the port frees" alone passes on the old code
// too (it freed at 5s); "the reply keeps arriving after it frees" is what the 5s
// ceiling could never do, because cutting the reply is how it got there.
