// Tests for forward-proxy attach-failure fallback semantics in proxy/server.mjs.
//
// Codex blocker #3 on PR #251: when CACHE_FIX_FORWARD_PROXY=on but
// attachForwardProxy() throws (e.g. openssl missing), the proxy must actually
// fall back to reverse-proxy-only behavior — /health already reports
// forward_proxy:false, but request routing keyed on config.forwardProxy (the
// env var), so non-/v1/messages paths were still passthrough-relayed upstream
// instead of keeping the reverse-mode 404 contract. The process-wide self-heal
// (uncaughtException/unhandledRejection swallowers) likewise must only be
// installed when forward mode actually attached, and must be removed again on
// close() so an embedded/shared process is not left with altered crash
// semantics after the forward-mode instance is gone.

// UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT while plain HTTP was fine. The cause is one call
// away from the fix — resolveHop() consults fallbackProxyUrls(), and its ONLY
// caller was forwardRequest() (plain HTTP). Both CONNECT paths read
// config.httpsProxy directly, which is fed by CACHE_FIX_UPSTREAM_PROXY /
// HTTPS_PROXY and NEVER by CACHE_FIX_FALLBACK_PROXIES. With only the fallback
// configured — the shipped wiring — that value is "" and CONNECT dialled
// direct, straight into the corporate MITM.
//
// It hid for as long as it did because the host everyone probes is the one CCF
// MITMs: api.anthropic.com goes down the relay path, comes back re-signed by
// our own CA, and reads authorized=true. Only the hosts CCF does NOT MITM take
// the blind tunnel, and those are exactly the login hosts. Measured on the work
// Mac, same box, same minute:
//   claude.ai / console.anthropic.com via 9901 -> UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT
//   the same two              via 8118 -> authorized=true, Let's Encrypt
//
// AND THE TRANSPORT TO THE HOP MUST FOLLOW THE HOP'S OWN SCHEME.
//
// parseProxy() returned only { host, port }. The port was already defaulted from
// the scheme (443 for https), so an `https://hop` was dialled on the RIGHT PORT
// with the WRONG PROTOCOL: http.request sent a plaintext CONNECT line to a TLS
// listener, which never answers one. The tunnel then hung to its timeout while
// hopAlive()'s TCP probe kept saying the hop was fine, so the chain went on
// picking it instead of falling through.
//
// forwardRequest's path never had this — buildAgent hands proxyUrl to
// HttpsProxyAgent, which reads the scheme itself. One chain, dialled correctly
// by one caller and in the clear by two others.
//
