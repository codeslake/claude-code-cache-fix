// A FIXTURE THAT STOPPED LISTENING IS STILL A FIXTURE.
//
// Every held-port/handover case sweeps its ports through listeners(), which is
// `lsof -sTCP:LISTEN`. That finds a process only while it HOLDS THE LISTEN — and
// the standby's whole job is to hand the listen on and keep carrying the
// address. After a handover it is a live process that no sweep can see.
//
// Measured on this box, one orphan of each kind side by side:
//   pid=2404217 ppid=1 port=45855  lsof-sees-it=0   bin/gap-relay.mjs
//   pid=2406768 ppid=1 port=41031  lsof-sees-it=1   bin/gap-relay.mjs
// The invisible ones accumulate: ten at once, the oldest 788 s, across files and
// runs. They hold ports and CPU, and the next file's readiness assertions time
// out on them — which is the shape every "node 20 flake" on this PR has had.
//
// So cleanup must identify a fixture by something that survives handing the
// listen on. The port it was GIVEN is in its environment and stays there.
