// A DEFAULT INSTALL MUST NOT GROW A FILE FOREVER.
//
// templates/com.cnighswonger.cache-fix-proxy.plist.template sends both streams
// to files:
//     StandardOutPath   {LOG_DIR}/cache-fix-proxy.log
//     StandardErrorPath {LOG_DIR}/cache-fix-proxy.err
// launchd opens them append-only and nothing in this repo ever truncated them.
// Measured on this fleet: 8.3 MB over 37 days on one Mac (~224 KB/day), 968 KB
// over 47 days on another. The rate tracks traffic, so the bound is the disk.
//
// systemd is not exposed — its unit sets no Standard* at all, so output goes to
// journald, which the system already caps. This is the macOS path, and it is
// the DEFAULT one rather than a debug opt-in.
//
// THE CAP HAS TO WORK THROUGH fd 2 ALONE. launchd hands over a descriptor and
// not a path, and there is no portable way back (Linux has /proc/self/fd,
// macOS needs fcntl F_GETPATH, which node does not expose). Measured:
//     fstatSync(2)      works — size
//     readSync(2, ...)  EBADF: the fd is write-only (O_WRONLY|O_APPEND)
//     ftruncateSync(2)  works, and later writes land at 0
// So a tail cannot be preserved and the cap is a truncate. It keeps the NEWEST
// lines, which is the half worth keeping.
