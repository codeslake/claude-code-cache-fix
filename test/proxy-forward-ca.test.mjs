// final re-check in `salvageBundle` (`return bundleUsable(path, leaf).ok ? ...`)
// has no test that dies when it is removed. Three attempts failed and the third
// explains the other two.
//
// For the re-check to matter, salvage must KEEP a file that breaks the merge.
// The keep rule admits `true` and `null`, so that needs a file whose probe
// answers `null` — and `null` is not a per-file condition. It means the probe
// could not run at all: no leaf to serve, no interpreter, a kill. Those apply
// to every candidate at once, so either nothing is kept (and salvage returns
// null before the re-check) or everything is, and a rebuild of everything
// reproduces the bundle we could not judge — which is the intended answer for
// "we could not ask", not a defect the re-check should catch.
//
// Measured while trying: a genuine breaker
// (`-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY----------BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`, verified to load 0
// certificates beside our CA) is answered `false` and dropped by the loop, so
// the re-check never sees it. Files that pass pairwise still pass concatenated
// here, because `nl()` normalises the joint that would otherwise fuse.
//
// So the re-check is a backstop for a case this code cannot currently produce.
// It stays because the keep rule is the thing most likely to be widened by the
// next person, and widening it is exactly what makes the case reachable. A test
// would need a probe that fails for ONE file and not the others — that is a
// seam this module does not have, and inventing one to test a backstop is worse
// than recording why the backstop is unreachable today.

// NODE_OPTIONS can `--require` a module that writes to stdout before our
// sentinel. Left in the probe's environment it forges an accept: the preload
// prints `CATRUST-OK 1`, the regex matches it, and a bundle whose true verdict
// is refuse is accepted. Its sibling NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED is covered
// above; this one was not, and both are one line in the same object.

// `verifiesOurLeaf` answers FOUR values — true / false / null / "local" — and
// the keep rule admits two of them by name. `"local"` matches neither arm, so
// it falls through with `false` and the publisher is DROPPED.
//
// `"local"` is an unknown, not a refusal: it means our own leaf key/cert pair
// does not serve (forward-proxy.mjs documents a two-rename window where the two
// come from different generations), so the probe never reached a handshake and
// says nothing about the file it was handed. Dropping on it discards every
// publisher on a host whose bundle is perfect, which is the loss this function
// exists to prevent — and it is the same defect as collapsing `unknown` into a
