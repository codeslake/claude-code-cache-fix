// route — never consulted this variable at all and dialled direct with it set.
//
// NOT EVERY EGRESS, and the exemptions are named rather than assumed. THREE
// other sites call getAgent() without asking:
//
//   forward-proxy.mjs storageAgent()      — a bucket URL, no client headers
//   forward-proxy.mjs fallbackToOrigin()  — FORWARDS THE CLIENT'S HEADERS
//   server.mjs        update-channel probe — our own request, no client headers
//
// The middle one is the reason this list is spelled out. An earlier version of
// this comment counted two and concluded "neither carries the caller's API
// key" — true of the two it named, and never established for the one it
// missed, which is precisely the one defined by passing the client's headers
// through verbatim. It reaches downloads.claude.ai only, on the opt-in
// download-rewrite path, and it is the honest place to look first if that path
// ever carries anything authenticating. Counted, not covered.
//
// THE ARGUMENT FOR LEAVING IT OPEN OUTLIVED ITS FACTS. It was: throwing in
// forwardRequest would HANG the client, because handleMessages' catch begins
// `if (abortController.signal.aborted) return` and the abort fired on
// clientReq's own "close", which Node emits when the request BODY completes —
// not only when the client leaves. Measured at the time: throw caught with
// aborted=true, writableEnded=false, no response, client timed out at 10 s.
//
// At HEAD the abort is keyed off clientRes' "close" gated by writableEnded
// (server.mjs), which separates "we answered" from "client gone" and never
// fires on a finished body. So the throw reaches the same catch and becomes the
// 502 that catch already writes, on all three forwardRequest call sites. The
// hang the argument rested on is unreachable, and with it the reason to keep an
// egress hole open on the route that carries the credentials.
//
// Refusal now lives at the top of forwardRequest(). A bypassed host is still
// exempt here: NO_PROXY is an operator saying "this one is direct on purpose".
// The CONNECT paths do NOT consult shouldBypassProxy, so a NO_PROXY'd host is
// refused there and exempt here. Left as it is because the two answer different
// questions — CONNECT is asked to tunnel an arbitrary host, this is asked to
// relay to the configured upstream — but it is an asymmetry, not a symmetry,
// and an earlier version of this comment claimed the opposite.

  //  - a brand-new socket that errors before it ever finished connecting (its
  //    'connect' event for plain HTTP, 'secureConnect' for TLS) — a hop that
  //    resets the CONNECT before replying, or a TLS handshake failure. No
  //    request byte can have gone out; the request stream buffers until that
  //    event, and if the event never fires there was no socket to write to.
  //  - a REUSED keep-alive socket that fails with ECONNRESET — Node's own
  //    documented idiom (`req.reusedSocket`) for "the peer had already closed
  //    this idle socket; the write landed on a dead connection". Node's Agent
  //    prunes a socket it has *seen* close from its free list, so this only
  //    fires on the reset-in-flight race the idle timeout above narrows but
  //    cannot fully close.
  //
  // Never past this point: after a response byte (this function has already
  // resolved by then — see `settled`), after a completed handshake on a fresh
  // socket (a post-connect failure is a real, current error), when the
  // caller's signal is already aborted, or more than once.
