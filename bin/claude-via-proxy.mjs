// that process.stderr is synchronous on a file, so ENOSPC/EBADF throws at the
// write and a caller's catch would then reclassify a healthy holder as a
// stranger. MEASURED on node v24.11.1, stderr redirected to a file with fd 2
// closed, both polarities: `process.stderr.write()` RETURNED NORMALLY
// ("sync result: no-throw") and the failure surfaced afterwards as an
// asynchronous 'error' event — uncaught without a listener, delivered to the
// listener with one. So the catch here has never caught anything, and the
// consequence chain that paragraph described could not occur through it.
//
// The actual protection is the pair of stream 'error' listeners installed at the
// top of holdPort() — see the block there, which spells out why a dead reader
// must not take the supervisor with it. Not at module scope, and NOT in this
// file's other modes: the interactive wrapper deliberately has no such listener,
// so on that path a write to a dead pipe still ends the process, which for a
// foreground producer is correct.
//
// The try stays because it costs nothing and covers the one shape that DOES
// throw synchronously: a non-string argument from a future caller
// (ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE). A destroyed stream does NOT — measured,
// `process.stderr.destroy(); process.stderr.write("x")` returns normally. And

//    so an over-age record can be lost in the window before its relay takes over.
// 2. A record is keyed by PORT ALONE, and this asks about bindAddr(). A holder on
//    another address reads as free to a reaper on loopback. Probing the wildcard
//    would close it and open a worse one — an externally reachable socket per
//    over-age record — and carrying the address would change the record format.
// 3. The probe is itself a listener while it asks, so a launcher in otherHolderOn()
//    can read it as an incumbent, print "this one is surplus" and settle(0),
//    leaving the port empty. Needs a record for the exact port a second launcher
//    is binding, i.e. one idle seven days and then reused.
//
// All three end in the same place: runningOurCode() answers null and takeOver()
// exits 0 announcing a deploy that has not taken effect. The local variant of 3
// cannot happen — listen() is the last synchronous statement of holdPort's
// executor, so this launcher already owns its own port when the reap runs.

    // Not gated on being under a test: a holder orphaned in production is the

    // ONLY WHEN A SUPERVISOR ASKS FOR IT. Reparenting to init is the NORMAL
    // launch here, not a death: `wire.zsh` starts us with `&!` and the shell

      // record naming a build nothing serves — and that one self-corrects,
      // because the restart ladder republishes on every attempt and a port with
      // no listener never reaches this comparison at all.

        //   - "narrow to our CA whenever we could not judge" — honest, and it
        //     costs a healthy merge every OTHER publisher on the box. Measured:
        //     2 CAs on disk, 1 handed over, and the ambient corporate root the

        // not be judged, so an unmeasured answer must land on `caPem` — the one
        // file we have direct evidence for. What made that wrong before was the
        // PROBE returning `true` when it could not ask, not the test here: on
        // any runtime before v22.15 (most of `engines: >=18`) that was every
        // launch with a stale merge. Salvage's gate takes the opposite default,

        // a non-answer as a yes, which `null` being falsy already gives it.

  // pointing at the system store, which cannot hold our root by construction.

  // named before. We do not write them at all — see the block below for why the

    // that no longer subsumes anything. On a corporate laptop the failure is
    // total: system roots gone means no internet and every enterprise function
    // dead, while our own proxy keeps working, so everything looks fine from
    // inside the tool.
