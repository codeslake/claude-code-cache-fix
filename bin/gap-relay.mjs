// accepting, every client waiting out its own timeout. Inheriting the
// descriptor has no bind in it, so it works in every state the port can be in.
// Its own file because the launcher treats an unrecognised subcommand as
// arguments for claude, so a dispatch branch there is never reached.

// one, and straight to the origin by terminating CONNECT when there is not.
// "Everything off" is a real state on these machines, and a session's

// "inherit", so it shares the holder's pipe — and it writes to that pipe on
// every unusable hop, on a server error, and on arming. When the pipe's last
// reader dies (the measured case: a `... | tee` killed during cleanup), the
// next write raises EPIPE as an asynchronous 'error' event with no listener,
// which Node promotes to uncaughtException. The one process whose entire job is
// to keep this socket answering would then exit because a log line had nowhere
// to go. proxy/server.mjs took this guard in 94e1953; this file and the

  // holder takes the port by asking everything still on it to let go, which is

  // We do NOT stand down on our own. An earlier draft closed the server and
  // exited when a probe returned 200, which is irreversible: the proxy that
  // answered can die a moment later and there is no descriptor left to re-arm
  // with. Measured on that draft — the address went to ECONNREFUSED in exactly
  // the sequence this exists to survive. Yielding is the claimant's decision,
  // made with SIGHUP, not ours.
